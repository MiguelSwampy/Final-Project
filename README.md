## The Experiment 
Miguel Swampy

This code runs an expirement to determine reaction time. 
In the first block, a sequence of colored stimuli are presented.
In the second block, a random order of colored stimuli are presented.
The timing between stimulus presentation is randomized to negate predictability. 

The first block tests if there's a difference in reaction time between colors.
The second block tests if there's a difference in reaction time when the sequence of colors is randomized.

Stimuli: a fixation cross succeded by sqaures colored either red, green, or blue.
The fixation cross is presented for 1-3 seconds. Exactly how long it will be there is determined randomly.
The squares are presented for as long as it takes the participant to press the spacebar. 
The particapnt is given instructions to press the spacebar whenever the square appears on screen and to continue between blocks
and once they're finished reading the instructions. 

The color of the square, time between the square's presentation and participant input, time between each presentation of squares,
block, and trial number are all recorded. 

A folder labeled 'data' is created where a .csv file named after the participants subject ID, age, and gender is stored.
